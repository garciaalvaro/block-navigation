Block Navigation sidebar panel for the new Block editor.


== Description ==

[Demo](https://gutenberg-showcase.melonpan.io/block-navigation) - [Documentation](https://melonpan.io/wordpress-plugins/block-navigation) - [GitHub](https://github.com/garciaalvaro/block-navigation)

Block Navigation provides a sidebar with the current post/page’s blocks and some tools to facilitate the editing process in the new Gutenberg editor.


== Features ==

The features are especially useful for nested blocks – blocks that are inside parent blocks which are difficult to select or move in the editor.

Inside the panel several utilities are included to enhance the UX, such as:

* Dragging blocks to a different location
* Moving blocks by click
* Selecting blocks
* Easily recognising the block from a small snippet of the block’s content

The user can select a dark or light color scheme, from the multiple included.


== Plugin and Theme developers ==

The plugin also provides some features for Plugin and Theme developers, such as:

* Click and Copy the block’s clientId
* Click to console.log helpful data from the block


== Screenshots ==

1. Main view, dark scheme.
2. Dragging a block to a different position.
3. Block menu.
4. List of available color schemes, light and dark.

== Usage ==

Inside the Post editor on the right side of the top Block's Toolbar the plugin icon/button should appear (if not, please read the FAQ below).
Click the icon/button to open the plugin sidebar.

== Installation ==

Installation from the WordPress admin.

1. Log in to the WordPress admin and navigate to Plugins > Add New.
2. Type "Block Navigation" in the Search field.
3. In the results list Block Navigation plugin should appear, click **Install Now** button.
4. Once it finished installing, click the Activate button.
5. That's it, now you can go to any post where Gutenberg is enabled and start using the plugin.
